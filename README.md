- Once you've started BotFather, enter `/newbot`
- Then, enter your bot name and a username. Notice that the bot's username should be finished with `bot`
- Now you should recieve an API Token. Save this information for later use.
- Finally, search for your newly created robot on Telegram and start it!

### Install

- On your bash, go to the directory of your preference and run `git clone git@github.com:enionsouza/Telegram-Bot.git`
- Next run `cd Telegram-Bot/config`
- Open the file named `robot_token-example.txt` with the editor of your preference.
- Now, replace the provided example of API Token with the token that you've receirved from BotFather, in the previous step. Save this edited file in this same directory with the name `robot_token.txt`
- Next, on your bash, run `cd ..`
- Finally, to run the required gems used in this project run `bundle install`

### Run tests

- To run the tests, go to your `Telegram-Bot` directory, and run `rspec`

### Usage and Deployment

- Now that you're in `Telegram-Bot` directory, run `cd bin`
- To turn your Telegram Robot on, either run `./main.rb` or `ruby main.rb`
- Now go to your Telegram Robot and enter `/help`. The other available commands should appear on your screen, as the robot's response

### About the quotes and jokes sources

- For this project, the quotes and jokes were web scraped from the following pages:
  - [Get Inspired: 200+ Motivational Quotes To Encourage Your Success](https://www.shopify.com/blog/motivational-quotes)
  - [145 Best Dad Jokes That Will Have the Whole Family Laughing](https://www.countryliving.com/life/a27452412/best-dad-jokes/)
  - [50 Funny Short Jokes That Guarantee a Laugh](https://bestlifeonline.com/funny-short-jokes/)
  - [75 Short Jokes Anyone Can Remember](https://www.readersdigest.ca/culture/10-short-jokes-anyone-can-remember/)
- The web scraping was automatically performed and, _for testing purposes_, you can also delete the directory named `src` along with all its content files. When `./main.rb` is run in the `bin` directory, new source files will be regenerated from the mentioned sources. You can also re-run the RSpec tests, for sanity check of the newly generated source files.
